Title:
Measurements and simulations of secondary organic aerosols from BVOC

Introduction:
This paper presents measurements of 
secondary organic aerosols, formed from
biological VOC emissions.
J. Bloggs et al 2010 have made some lovely measurements
but they haven't answered question X about the
science.
J. Smith et al 2011 attempted to investigate question X,
but further work is needed.

Methodology:
A state of the art aerosol mass spectrometer was used to measure
chemical composition and mass concentrations, as described in
Allen et al 2004.

Simulations:
Simulations of SOA were made using an atmospheric
model.

Results:
The simulations did a fair job of approximating the measurements.

Conclusions:
We found out some stuff. Splendid. Science has advanced,
but we haven't stopped yet.
