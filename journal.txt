Title:
Measurements and simulations of organic aerosols

Introduction:
This paper presents measurements of 
secondary organic aerosols, formed from
biological VOC emissions.
J. Bloggs et al 2010 have made some lovely measurements
but they haven't answered question X about the
science.
J. Smith et al 2011 attempted to investigate question X,
but further work is needed.
